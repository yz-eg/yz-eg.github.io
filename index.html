      <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
		<dl class="dl-horizontal">
			<dt><a href="./1-Introduction/">1. Introduction</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we try to explain why we consider artificial intelligence to be a subject
			most worthy of study, and in which we try to decide what exactly it is, this being a
			good thing to decide before embarking.</dd>
			<dt><a href="./2-Intelligent-Agents/">2. Intelligent Agents</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we discuss the nature of agents, perfect or otherwise, the diversity of
			environments, and the resulting menagerie of agent types.</dd>

    <div id="part2" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
      <dl class="dl-horizontal">
			<dt><a href="./3-Solving-Problems-By-Searching/">3. Solving Problems By Searching</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we see how an agent can find a sequence of actions that achieves its
			goals when no single action will do.</dd>
			<dt><a href="./4-Beyond-Classical-Search/">4. Beyond Classical Search</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we relax the simplifying assumptions of the previous chapter, thereby
			getting closer to the real world.</dd>
			<dt><a href="./5-Adversarial-Search/">5. Adversarial Search</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we examine the problems that arise when we try to plan ahead in a world
			where other agents are planning against us.</dd>
			<dt><a href="./6-Constraint-Satisfaction-Problems/">6. Constraint Satisfaction Problems</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we see how treating states as more than just little black boxes leads to the
			invention of a range of powerful new search methods and a deeper understanding
			of problem structure and complexity.</dd>

      <h3>Knowledge Reasoning and Planning</h3>
      <dl class="dl-horizontal">
			<dt><a href="./7-Logical-Agents/">7. Logical Agents</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we design agents that can form representations of a complex world, use a
			process of inference to derive new representations about the world, and use these
			new representations to deduce what to do.</dd>
			<dt><a href="./8-First-Order-Logic/">8. First Order Logic</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we notice that the world is blessed with many objects, some of which are
			related to other objects, and in which we endeavor to reason about them.</dd>
			<dt><a href="./9-Inference-In-First-Order-Logic/">9. Inference In First Order Logic</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we define effective procedures for answering questions posed in firstorder
			logic.</dd>
			<dt><a href="./10-Classical-Planning/">10. Classical Planning</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we see how an agent can take advantage of the structure of a problem to
			construct complex plans of action.</dd>
			<dt><a href="./11-Planning-And-Acting-In-The-Real-World/">11. Planning and Acting in the Real World</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we see how more expressive representations and more interactive agent
			architectures lead to planners that are useful in the real world.</dd>
			<dt><a href="./12-Knowledge-Representation/">12. Knowledge Representation</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we show how to use first-order logic to represent the most important
			aspects of the real world, such as action, space, time, thoughts, and shopping.</dd>

      <h3>Uncertain Knowledge and Reasoning</h3>
      <dl class="dl-horizontal">
			<dt><a href="./13-Quantifying-Uncertainity/">13. Quantifying Uncertainity</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we see how an agent can tame uncertainty with degrees of belief.</dd>
			<dt><a href="./14-Probabilistic-Reasoning/">14. Probabilistic Reasoning</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we explain how to build network models to reason under uncertainty
			according to the laws of probability theory.</dd>
			<dt><a href="./15-Probabilistic-Reasoning-Over-Time/">15. Probabilistic Reasoning Over Time</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we try to interpret the present, understand the past, and perhaps predict
			the future, even when very little is crystal clear.</dd>
			<dt><a href="./16-Making-Simple-Decisions/">16. Making Simple Decisions</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we see how an agent should make decisions so that it gets what it wants on average, at least.</dd>
			<dt><a href="./17-Making-Complex-Decisions/">17. Making Complex Decisions</a></dt>
			<dd>In which we examine methods for deciding what to do today, given that we may
			decide again tomorrow.</dd>

			study of their own experiences.</dd>

			<dd>In which we examine how an agent can learn from success and failure, from reward
			and punishment.</dd>

			natural language.</dd>
